# This a numbers game

You have five guesses to guess the correct number. You'll get hints on if you're warm, hot or cold.

Download this repo to your local machine and open up index.html in the root. If you want to see the logic behind the game checkout the js folder for the numbers-game file.

This is a game, I made after learning concepts about functional programming and object-oriented programming before I got into coding bootcamp.
